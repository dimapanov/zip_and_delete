# 🗂️ Recursive File Zipping Bash Script
This Bash script 📜 recursively finds all files 🗃️ in the current directory and its subdirectories, zips each into its own ZIP file 📦, and then removes the original file 🗑️. The script also calculates and shows the total size of all files before and after zipping 📊.

**⚠️ Warning! This script will delete the original files after zipping them. Use it with extreme caution! ☠️**

## 🚀 Quick Usage

To download, make executable, and run the script in one go, you can use:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimapanov/zip_and_delete/master/zip_and_delete.sh && chmod +x zip_and_delete.sh && ./zip_and_delete.sh
```
