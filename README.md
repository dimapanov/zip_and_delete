# Recursive File Zipping Bash Script
This Bash script  recursively finds all files  in the current directory and its subdirectories, zips each into its own ZIP file , and then removes the original file.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning! This script will delete the original files after zipping them. Use it with extreme caution! ‚ò†Ô∏è**

## üöÄ Quick Usage

To download, make executable, and run the script in one go, you can use:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimapanov/zip_and_delete/master/zip_and_delete.sh && chmod +x zip_and_delete.sh && ./zip_and_delete.sh
```
